- [Project Overview](#Project_Overview)
  
  The dataset includes information on hospital admissions, covering patient demographics, medical 
 conditions, admission details and billing amount.
 Conducted a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations. Utilized statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to extract insights from the data.

*Key Findings*
- Identified the elderly age group as having the highest billing amount.
- Determined that the medical condition with the highest billing cost was associated with a patient intake of 1,703.
- Discovered that blood type AB+ had the most expensive billing amount.
- Analyzed admission types and found that Urgent admissions had the highest billing cost.
- Identified Cigna as the insurance provider with the most expensive billing cost.
- Determined the proportion of female to male patients and analyzed test results.
This 
analysis would enhance hospital management decisions, optimizing patient care, and minimizing 
costs.
